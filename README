NiceURLs Filter by sergiolopes
==============================

A Java Servlet Filter to help you implement nice external URLs and SEO. It has 
features to implement many kinds of redirects (301, 302, server-side, client-side).
It's something like Apache's mod_rewrite or UrlRewriteFilter but much simpler.

Just create a file called niceurls.routes and put in your classpath. This file has
a special syntax to configure the redirects. To learn the syntax, please see the 
test file:
