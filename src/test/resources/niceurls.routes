# NiceURLs Filter, by Sergio Lopes (sergio.lopes at caelum.com.br)
# Example configuration file

# NOTES
# This is a very simple text format, very similar to a regular .properties.
# Main differences are that order matters and it has a special syntax.
# See examples below.

# Client side redirection (using sendRedirect)
/index.jsp     >>    /

# Wildcard support - anything matches
/images/*/     >>   /blocked.html

# Redirection to external sources
/vraptor/      >>    http://vraptor.org

# Client side redirection with moved permanently header (301)
/old.jsp      >>>    /new.jsp

# All comments lines start with #
# /comment/    >>    /ignored.html

# Server side redirect, useful to implement AlwaysLinkToAction pattern
# or to call an internal framework
/mycompany/    =>    /jsp/mycompany.jsp

# URL parameters support
#  - Parameter syntax: ":" followed by the parameter name (characters and/or numbers)
#  - All parameters are available via request.getParameter 

/blog/:{year}/:{month}/      => /listPosts.action?year=#{year}&month=#{month}
/search/:{query}/            >> /search?q=#{query}
/admin/:{page}.jsp  >>    /admin/#{page}/

# Defining advanced params
/inject/:{mybean.id}/  => /injectTest.action

# We have also include support
#include more.routes

# Also, we can ignore some URLs (just call doFilter)
/ignore >>!
